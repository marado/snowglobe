This is a fork of http://omvviewer.byteme.org.uk , and I only intend to
maintain it as long as Robin doesn't release anything else there (last release
was 17 months ago).

I started doing this because he has no packages for Debian wheezy, nor for the 
latest Ubuntu releases. Linking to newer libraries is not enough, so here's 
my attempt to do so...

Note that:
1) I'm only focusing on snowglobe and not on snowglobe2. No particular reason, 
   I simply had to start somewhere;
2) As this is right now, it is intented for you to download the whole thingie
   and `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b` it for yourself;
3) You'll need to have Robin's repos anyway;
4) You'll have to start building the dependencies first, then install it, 
   and only then you build snowglobe

If I dedicate time for this, this will probably end up being the place where 
you find the code for some deb's that you'll find RFP'd on Debian and present
in an Ubuntu PPA. No such luck for now.

If you want to help me, or grab the task yourself, that would be very much 
appreciated. If not, don't expect to have anything useable any time soon (or
at all).
