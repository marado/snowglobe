On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General
Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL'.

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the GPL:

You are free to distribute a work based on the Program that is formed entirely
from the Viewer Software (and any modifications thereof) and one or more works
that are independent and separate works not derived from the Viewer Software,
and are licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 1
(each, a "FLOSS Work") , as long as:

   1. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Viewer Software and any work
      based on the Program, except for the FLOSS Works, for which you must comply
      with B below,

   2. all FLOSS Works,

		 1. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below,
            and

		 2. the object code or executable form of the FLOSS Works are
            accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for
            those FLOSS Works on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the
            corresponding object code or executable forms thereof, and 

   3. any works that are aggregated with the Viewer Software or a work based on
      the Program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with
      the GPL, and are not licensed under the FLOSS licenses listed below, are
      independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of
      either the Viewer Software, a work based on the Program or a FLOSS Work. 

If the above conditions are not met, then the Viewer Software may only be
copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL
or another valid licensing option from Linden Lab.

2. Definitions

Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.

3. Applicability

This FLOSS Exception applies to all Viewer Software files that contain a notice
placed by Linden Lab saying that the Viewer Software may be distributed under
the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is
a work based on the Program for the Viewer Software and any other work licensed
under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work; thus,
you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply with the
GPL in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to
redistribute a copy of the Viewer Software exclusively under the terms of the
GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Viewer
Software, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or any third
party.
